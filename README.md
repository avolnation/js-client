This project requires NPM(Node Package Manager) to run local web server ```Note: you cant run it directly by just double-clicking index.html, due to CORS policy```.

```sh
npm install --global http-server
```
After installation, run server in the same folder just by typing in console:
```sh
 http-server
```
